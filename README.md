- GEST: Gestational age (in weeks) at study entry.
- DILATE: Cervical dilatation (in cm).
- EFFACE: Cervical effacement (in %).
- CONSIS : Cervical consistency (1 = soft, 2 = medium, 3 = firm).
- CONTR: Presence (1) or absence (2) of contractions.

4. Display general information about the dataset:
- General structure
- Number of rows and columns
